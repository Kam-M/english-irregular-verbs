# English-Irregular-Verbs App
Simple command line app to learn and memorize english irregular verbs (includes polish translations of verbs).

Features:
- view all available verbs (sorted by translation or by infinitive),
- add new verbs or remove existing,
- view random verb and try to learn it (after that you will be asked if you want to mark the verb as learnt),
- two separate lists available: Main List and Learnt Verbs List,
- move all verbs from Learnt List back to Main List,
- clear entire Main List(be careful, cannot be undone),
- play a simple quiz where you will be prompted for typing the correct form of a randomly generated verb from choosen list,
- count quiz score,
- verbs are stored in external files and update every time user decide to add/delete/move verb between lists.

Launching runnable JAR (should be system independent, tested od Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 7):
1. Download .jar file.
2. Unpack it (to the same directory whre you stored jar file).
3. Open command line.
4. 'cd' to the directory where are stored above mentioned files.
5. Type 'java -jar English-Irregular-Verbs.jar' and press Enter.
6. Enjoy!

This isn't the final version of the app. I am constantly changing the source code and updating list of available verbs. I try to combine learning programming and learning english :)
