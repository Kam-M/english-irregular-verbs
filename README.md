# English-Irregular-Verbs App
Simple command line app to learn and memorize english irregular verbs (includes polish translations of verbs).

Features included at this moment:
- view all available verbs (sorted by translation or by infinitive),
- add new verbs or remove existing,
- view random verb and try to learn it (after that you will be asked if you want to mark the verb as learnt),
- two separate lists available: Main List and Learnt Verbs List,
- move all verbs from Learnt List back to Main List,
- clear entire Main List(be careful, cannot be undone),
- play a simple quiz where you will be prompted for typing the correct form of a randomly generated verb from choosen list,
- count quiz score,
- verbs are stored in external files and updated before quitting app if user decided to add/delete/move verb between lists.

This is the first version of this app. I am constantly changing the source code and updating list of available verbs. I try to combine learning programming and learning english :) 

Please check new version of the source code where I have added test suites and switched to using database instead files (available in separate repository).
